Welcome to your WordPress website on Cloud9 IDE!

To get you started, we've already...

1) Started MySQL using:

   $ mysql-ctl start

2) Clicked the Run Project button

3) Clicked on Preview > Preview Running Application

And now you are ready to configure your WordPress admin interface!

## Databases

You might need to change the database. There is some great information on how Cloud9 does this [here](https://community.c9.io/t/setting-up-mysql/1718).

You can find passwords and usernames in the wp-config.php if it is present, or search through your web host for information on SQL usernames.

Inside this repository is an instance of [Search and Replace](https://github.com/interconnectit/Search-Replace-DB). You can view their documentation for more information.
